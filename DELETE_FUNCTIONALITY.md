## Testing

The delete functionality has been tested with:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Next.js build process
- ✅ Component rendering
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Error handling

## Notes

- All delete operations are immediate and permanent
- No cascade deletion is implemented (deleting a business doesn't automatically delete associated products/invoices)
- The UI maintains consistency with the existing design system
- Delete buttons are positioned to avoid accidental clicks
